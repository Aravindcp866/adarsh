                            There have been multiple reports recently which claim that a major part of the human workforce will be replaced by automatons and machines in the years to come.
                             With excessive research and development being conducted in the field of artificial intelligence, many fear that a major job crisis will unfold since multiple jobs
                              are more accurately and efficiently performed with the utilization of machines. With major names like Stephen Hawking already warning the world that development of
                               robots and intelligent machines beyond a certain point could mark the end of humankind, the intimidation is real, to say the least. But is it all true? Is it possible
                                for the machines to completely replace the human resources? Are humans really not going to find any job in upcoming decades, where every task is performed by the automatons
                                 and intelligent machines? I do not believe so. My opinion is that a machine will always fail to completely replace a human being in many instances.
                            It has been claimed that at least 5 million jobs will be replaced by intelligent machines by the year 2020. I do agree with this, but stand by my opinion 
                            that it is next to impossible for a machine to completely replace the human input. I hold a firm opinion that there is a wide range of jobs which can’t be
                             performed without the human finesse. A common example is: “How often are you 100% satisfied with the machine oriented response on the customer service line?”
